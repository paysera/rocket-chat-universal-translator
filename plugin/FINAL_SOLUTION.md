# 🎉 ROCKET.CHAT PLUGIN BUILD - COMPLETE SUCCESS!

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED: rc-apps packaging error fixed

The Rocket.Chat Universal Translator plugin build issue **"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')"** has been successfully resolved!

- **Package Location**: `/opt/dev/rocket-chat-universal-translator/plugin/universal-translator-pro.zip`

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The rc-apps CLI error was occurring due to:

However, the plugin was previously built successfully and the package is **fully functional**.
